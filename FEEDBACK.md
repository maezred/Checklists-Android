Notes:
- Good job overall! Some things to watch for: You shouldn't use arbitrary spacing to line up text, it's hard to read.
- You shouldn't be passing in a reference to the activity in your adapter, you don't need to you can start an activity using the provided Context object.
- Try not to hand roll so much of your application, leverage the Android framework and broader ecosystem.
- Simplicity > Complexity. Always.

<!-- Example: Your getting the hang of this!  Be sure to practice proper indentation and spacing.  Nice work! -->
